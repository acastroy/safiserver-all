This project contains source for SafiServer, SafiWorkshop, and the shared resources (SafletCore).

SafiServer is a server engine that powers the applications (called Saflets) created using SafiWorkshop.  The current use for this architecture is for call control using one or more Asterisk PBXs.

SafiWorkshop is an Eclipse-based graphical logic flow designer (currently geared towards the creation of call flow and IVR applications). With SafiWorkshop you can design, test, debug and deploy advanced routing applications from a single, unified development environment. SafiWorkshop also includes a prompt recorder/importer for managing IVR prompts and a fully featured SQL query editor.
