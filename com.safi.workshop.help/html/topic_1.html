		<b><img alt="" src="images/help/saflet.jpg" border="0" hspace="" vspace=""><br><br>Saflets</b> are flow applications created by using SafiWorkshop
and ran using SafiServer.&nbsp; Currently, Saflets can be used to create call flow (or IVR) type applications for use with Asterisk PBXs; but in the future you will be able to use Saflets for creating any kind of application flow&nbsp; (i.e. data import, directory polling, process flows, etc).<br><br>SafiWorkshop comes with a "mini" version of
SafiServer for testing and debugging Saflets.
