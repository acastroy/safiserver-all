		<h2>Installing SafiServer on Windows</h2><br>
		<h2 style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;
 
  <b>Installing SafiServer on Windows 32-bit</b>&nbsp;

<br></h2>
<br>Installation of the SafiServer on Windows is straight forward.&nbsp; The only part requiring some explanation is the IP address and port 
selection page:<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="images/help/serverInstallPortPage.jpg" border="0" vspace="" hspace=""><br><br></div><ol start="1" type="1"><li><b>Server Bind IP Address:</b> This is the IP address that the
     SafiServer will bind to and must be reachable from all Asterisk servers,
     and from the SafiWorkshop as well "0.0.0.0" is a "wildcard" IP address and, if specified, will cause the server to
     bind to <b>all</b> IPs available on
     the machine.</li></ol>

&nbsp;

<ol start="2" type="1"><li><b>Database</b><b> Port</b><b>: </b>The SafiServer utilizes a
     lightweight internal database to store Saflets (call flow applications),
     Asterisk server settings, SafiWorkshop users, and other system settings. The
     SafiWorkshop needs access to that database in order to retrieve/deploy
     Saflets, add/modify users, register Asterisk servers, etc. and it does so
     using that port (default: 7021).This port does not need to be open to the Asterisk servers.<b></b></li></ol>

<b>&nbsp;</b>

<ol start="3" type="1"><li><b>Management</b><b> Port</b><b>:</b> This port serves dual
     purposes.For one, the SafiWorkshop
     uses this port to receive real time logging and system information from
     the production SafiServer, useful for remote debugging and management.The management port is also used by something
     called the "Custom Initiator" to trigger Saflets remotely.A description and tutorial for the
     Custom Initiator is beyond the scope of this post but to summarize, the
     Custom Initiator allows one to invoke a Saflet remotely.For example, if you wanted to implement a "call back" function from a web page you could do that using the Custom
     Initiator. </li></ol>

<b>&nbsp;</b>

<ol start="4" type="1"><li><b>FastAGI</b><b> Port</b><b>:</b> This is the port upon which the SafiServer will accept FastAGI
     requests from the Asterisk server(s).The Asterisk default for this port is 4573.If set to anything other than the
     default then the port must then be specified explicitly from the
     originating FastAGI call in the extensions.conf (eg. exten =
     1111,1,Agi(agi://192.168.0.10:<b>4574</b>/safletEngine.agi?saflet=myproject/mysaflet).</li></ol>
