		<h2>SafiServer</h2><br>
		The SafiServer is the core component of the Safi Systems a<xml>r</xml>chitecture.&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on Java technology, the SafiServer can handle many threads of operation at once.&nbsp; SafiServer runs applications created using SafiWorkshop called Saflets.&nbsp; Currently these Saflets are focused around call flow type functionallity, but these applications can be used for any flow based situation.<br><br>There is a limited version of the SafiServer embedded inside the Saflet designer: SafiWorkshop.&nbsp; This allows SafiWorkshop the ability to test and debug Saflets locally (on the machine SafiWorkshop is installed on) before deploying to a production SafiServer.<br><br>The SafiServer has a telephony component to it that allows it to connect and control PBX devices (currently Asterisk Opensource PBX).&nbsp; This allows for the centralized control of callflow / IVR functionallity.&nbsp; SafiServer can connect to many PBX servers at once allowing for increased scalabilty.<br>
