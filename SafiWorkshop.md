SafiWorkshop is a visual call flow designer that allows users to quickly create and deploy powerful IVR, auto-attendants, and call routing scenarios.  SafiWorkshop (combined with SafiServer) are the beginnings of a powerful new architecture in telephony and business data design.

SafiWorkshop gives administrators ultimate control over their Asterisk deployments. Users can create, debug, and deploy Saflets (call flow diagrams) all from inside SafiWorkshop.

After a Saflet has been created and tested, it can easily be deployed to a standalone SafiServer for production use.
