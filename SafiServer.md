# SafiServer #


---


SafiServer is a standalone application server that supports a broad range of telephony applications and serves as the platform upon which everything from call routing to complex database driven IVRs can be built.  SafiServer is built on enterprise level technology and has been designed from the ground-up with extensibility, scalability and reliability in mind.

<h3>Saflets</h3>
Saflets are call flow applications created and tested using SafiWorkshop and deployed to the SafiServer for production use.  Saflets have a graphical representation much like a flowchart and can be debugged visually in real-time from the SafiWorkshop.<br>
<br><br><br>
<h3>Architecture</h3>
In the SafiSystems architecture, logical and physical processing power is distributed to maximize scalability, reliability, and functionality.  In a conventional Asterisk PBX environment, the Asterisk server is responsible for shouldering all the logical, database, and telephony demands related to call flow and IVR functionality.  In a SafiSystems environment, Asterisk servers become powerful low-level communication "appliances" and all other functionality is pushed out to the SafiServer.  Not only does this design result in improved scalability but also provides a consolidation point for all IVR and call flow applications for ease of management, enhanced functionality, and simplified application deployment.  These advantages becomes even more apparent in a multi-Asterisk server environment.<br>

<h3>Creativity and Simplicity</h3>
One of the primary goals of Safi Systems' technologies is to foster an environment of creativity and innovation. We want to equip IT professionals with the tools they need to quickly address and solve the most demanding problems.  SafiWorkshop uses an intuitive flowchart design language that makes implementing complex logic for IVRs or other telephony applications as easy as diagramming it out on a whiteboard.<br>
<br><br><br>
<h3>Testing, Debugging and Publishing</h3>
Another major advantage of the Safi Systems' development model is the ability to debug live calls. After a Saflet has been published to a SafiServer; it can be put into a debug mode that allows the developer to view the progress of the application step-by-step.<br>
<br>
Deploying a Saflet to a SafiServer is as easy as clicking the "Publish" button.  Once a Saflet has been published it goes into service immediately - the next call that comes in will invoke that Saflet. Current calls are not affected by the deployment, no server restart is required, and there are no configuration files to reload.  Modern business is dynamic and SafiServer has been built to facilitate that.<br>

<h3>Advanced Features and Expandability</h3>
SafiServer's feature-set can be given a boost through the addition of "ActionPaks".  ActionPaks include features such as database connectivity, email integration, web services, and many more.
